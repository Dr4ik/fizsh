fizsh (1.0.3) UPSTREAM; urgency=low

  * Release: 1.0.3

  * downloaded a recent version of zsh-history-substring-search from https://github.com/zsh-users (Wed, 12 Oct 2011 06:59:19 +0200)

  * downloaded a recent version of zsh-syntax-highlighting from https://github.com/zsh-users (Wed, 12 Oct 2011 06:59:38 +0200)

  * removed the startup options -r or --reinstall again. Reinstalling fizsh is now handled by calling a function "fizsh-reinstall" 

  * added a function "fizsh-upgrade", which enables the user to perform upgrades through the internet

  * added a script "fizsh-miscellaneous.zsh", which corrects some small bugs in "zsh-history-substring-search". "fizsh-miscellaneous.zsh" also provides the functions "fizsh-upgrade" and "fizsh-reinstall". 

  * prefixed all shell variables and functions with either "_fizsh" or "fizsh". An underscore indicates that a variale is meant for internal purposes. This conforms to the naming conventions that "oh-my-zsh" uses

fizsh (1.0.1) UPSTREAM; urgency=low

  * Release: 1.0.1

  * corrected a bug in /etc/fizsh/fizshrc (exit and logout caused fizsh to hang on Fedora (and perhaps on some other platforms too)

  * corrected a bug in /etc/fizsh/zsh-syntax-highlighting (pressing arrow-down would not highlight anything if the CURSOR was within BUFFER, and no matches were found) 

  * corrected a bug in /etc/fizsh/zsh-syntax-highlighting (starting a command with "-", "\-" or "-\" caused zsh to complain: "_zsh_check-path:4: bad option: -t")

  * corrected a bug in /usr/bin/modify_etc_shells (this script tried to remove "/usr/bin/fizsh" from "/etc/shells" without checking if fizsh had indeed been installed in "/usr/bin/". Now it safely removes "$(which fizsh)" from "/etc/shells")

  * corrected a bug in /usr/bin/fizsh (echoing "reverting to zsh" in "/usr/bin/fizsh" prevented "ssh - and thus scp and sftp - from logging into fizsh)

  * Adapted the build-system to automake

  * added the startup options -h or --help and -l or --login

  * moved and renamed /usr/bin/modify_etc_shells to /etc/fizsh/modify-etc-shells. modify_etc_shells's manpage has been removed

  * shortened directory names appearing in the prompt : "/usr/bin" -> /u/bin; "~/Documents/2011" -> ~/D/2011 (this is like in fish's prompt)

  * gave root a red prompt

  * performed some garbage collection in the fizsh scripts
  
  * improved the structure of the program
