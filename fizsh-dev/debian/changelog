fizsh (1.0.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version

  * Increased standards-version to 3.9.5. This yielded 2 warnings:
  syntax-error-in-dep5-copyright and debian-watch-may-check-gpg-signature

  * Corrected the dep5 syntax errors in ./debian/copyright

  * Upgraded from dep5 to copyright-format 1.0

  * Updated the years in ./debian/copyright

  * Added the option "pgpsigurlmangle" to ./debian/watch

  * Added ./debian/upstream/signing-key.asc

  * Added ./debian/README with information on how to debianize a new version
  of fizsh

  * Increased debian/compat to '9'

  * Increased the Build-depend on debhelper to '(>= 9)'

  * Added a build-depend on perl in order to enable the use of pod2man

  * Added override_dh_auto_configure. Without this override ./configure is
  called with unknown parameters

  * Added override_dh_install. dh_install copies some scripts to both
  debian/fizsh/etc/fizsh and debian/fizsh/usr/share/fizsh. override_dh_install
  removes them from debian/fizsh/usr/share/fizsh again

  * Added override_dh_installman. This override causes pod2man to create the
  manpage. It also takes care of some cleaning

  * Removed debian/fizsh.manpages because it is not needed anymore. 
  override_dh_installman takes care of creating the man page

  * Added override_dh_builddeb. This override removes a file called man/fizsh.1
  which is created during the debian building process

  * Removed the ./debian/patches directory and ./debian/source/options.
  Upstream corrected the issue, which the patch was addressing
